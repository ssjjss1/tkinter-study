Tkinter is a model required when developing a graphical user interface (GUI) in Python. If you use tkinter, use Windows. You can create a program that interacts with the user by creating and using widgets such as buttons or labels. Python has several GUI libraries, but tkinter is the most basic. Tkinter is also an educational tool that can easily understand the various concepts of object-oriented programming. In addition, tkinter allows you to use various graphic function numbers and receive input from the mouse and keyboard. To create a GUI application, first create a window and add widgets necessary for it. Widget (abbreviation for window gadget) refers to various visual elements used in GUI systems. Buttons, labels, sliders, and combo boxes are all widgets.
